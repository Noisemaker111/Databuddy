Track feature interactions to understand which features are most popular and how users engage with your application.

## Implementation

<CodeBlock 
  language="tsx"
  code={`import { track } from "@databuddy/sdk";
import { useCallback } from "react";

export function useFeatureTracking(featureName: string) {
  const trackUsage = useCallback(
    (action: string, properties?: Record<string, unknown>) => {
      track("feature_used", {
        feature: featureName,
        action,
        ...properties,
      });
    },
    [featureName]
  );

  return { trackUsage };
}`}
/>

## Usage

<CodeBlock 
  language="tsx"
  code={`function ExportButton() {
  const { trackUsage } = useFeatureTracking("export_data");

  const handleExport = async () => {
    trackUsage("export_started", { format: "csv" });
    try {
      await exportData();
      trackUsage("export_completed", { format: "csv" });
    } catch (error) {
      trackUsage("export_failed", { format: "csv", error: error.message });
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={handleExport}>Export</button>;
}`}
/>

## What It Tracks

- **Event**: `feature_used`
- **Properties**:
  - `feature`: Name of the feature being tracked
  - `action`: Specific action (e.g., "started", "completed", "failed")
  - Additional custom properties as needed

## Benefits

- **Feature Adoption**: Understand which features users actually use
- **Usage Patterns**: Track feature usage across different user segments
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track feature success/failure rates

<Callout type="info">
Use different actions (started, completed, failed) to track the full lifecycle of feature interactions.
</Callout>
